# SDM_SMRZA_IC
Image Captioning / Software Development Management Project / SMRZA group.
This neural system for image captioning is roughly based on the paper "Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generatorn" by Vinayls et al. (ICML2015).
We have added a module for translating English to Persian and converting text to speech here. the input is an image, and the outputs are an english and persian sentences describing the content of the image with a voice that expresses that sentence. It uses a convolutional neural network to extract visual features from the image, and uses a LSTM recurrent neural network to decode these features into a english sentence. We used googletrans and gtts modules in python to translate the English text into Persian and convert text to speech, respectively. This project is implemented using the Tensorflow library, and allows end-to-end training of both CNN and RNN parts .
